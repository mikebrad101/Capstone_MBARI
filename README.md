# Capstone_MBARI
Database Modernization project

Here's a breakdown of possible directory structure:

client/: This directory contains all the frontend code built with React. The public/ directory holds your static assets and the HTML template. The src/ directory is where your React components and application logic reside.

server/: This directory contains all the backend code built with Node.js and Express.js, which serves as the API for your React app.

config/: Configuration files, such as database configurations, environment variables, and other global settings.
controllers/: Controllers handle the application's business logic. You can have separate controllers for different parts of your app.
routes/: Define the API routes and how they map to your controllers.
app.js: The entry point for your Node.js server.
package.json: Contains project metadata, dependencies, and scripts. You'll have separate package.json files for the client and server if you're using a monorepo setup.

.gitignore: List of files and directories to be ignored by version control (e.g., node_modules, build files, environment files).

README.md: Documentation for your project, including installation and usage instructions.

Other files and directories: Include other files and directories as needed for your specific project, such as tests, scripts, or tools.
